NGS Data Analysis Pipeline
This repository contains a Nextflow-based pipeline for performing basic Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) data analysis.
The pipeline includes key steps like quality control (FastQC), adapter trimming (Trimmomatic), read alignment (BWA MEM), and variant calling (GATK HaplotypeCaller).

Features
FastQC for quality control of raw FASTQ files.
Trimmomatic for trimming adapters and low-quality sequences.
BWA MEM for aligning reads to a reference genome.
GATK HaplotypeCaller for variant calling.
Scalable and parallel execution using Nextflow, ensuring efficient use of computational resources.
Requirements
Software
Nextflow
FastQC
Trimmomatic
BWA
Samtools
GATK
Java (for running Trimmomatic)
Input
Paired-end FASTQ files.
Reference genome in FASTA format for alignment.
Installation
Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ngs-pipeline.git
cd ngs-pipeline
Install Nextflow:

Follow the official Nextflow installation guide.

Install required tools:

Ensure that FastQC, Trimmomatic, BWA, Samtools, and GATK are installed and accessible in your systemâ€™s PATH.

Pipeline Structure
The pipeline performs the following steps in sequence:

Quality Control (FastQC): Generates quality control reports for the input FASTQ files.
Trimming (Trimmomatic): Trims adapter sequences and low-quality bases from the reads.
Alignment (BWA MEM): Aligns the trimmed reads to a reference genome.
Variant Calling (GATK HaplotypeCaller): Identifies variants (SNPs and indels) in the aligned reads.
Running the Pipeline
Prepare input data:

Place your paired-end FASTQ files in a directory (e.g., ./fastq).
Ensure you have a reference genome in FASTA format (e.g., ./reference/genome.fa).
Modify the configuration:

You can modify the parameters (such as input/output directories and reference genome path)
in the Nextflow script (ngs_pipeline.nf) or provide them via the command line.
For example, the Nextflow script expects these default values:


params {
    fastq_dir = './fastq'
    output_dir = './output'
    reference = './reference/genome.fa'
    threads = 8
}
Run the pipeline:

Run the following command to execute the pipeline:


nextflow run ngs_pipeline.nf
This will execute the pipeline with the default parameters. You can override parameters directly from the command line if needed, for example:

nextflow run ngs_pipeline.nf --fastq_dir '/path/to/your/fastq' --reference '/path/to/your/reference.fa' --threads 4
Outputs:

FastQC reports: Generated in the output/fastqc folder.
Trimmed FASTQ files: Stored in the output/trimmed folder.
Aligned BAM files: Located in the output/alignment folder.
VCF files: Variant calls are stored in the output/variants folder.
Customization
Reference Genome: Update the params.reference path in the Nextflow script to use a different reference genome.
Threads: Adjust the number of threads using the --threads parameter when running the pipeline.
Trimmomatic parameters: Modify trimming settings in the trim_reads process inside ngs_pipeline.nf.
